# Stock Market Prediction Using CNN-LSTM
## Introduction
This repository contains a deep learning model that predicts the future behavior of a stock market. The model is developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained on historical stock market data and can be used to make predictions about future stock prices.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the code in this repository:
- Numpy
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Data
The stock market data used to train the model can be obtained from various sources, such as finance websites or APIs. The data should include historical stock prices and other relevant information, such as trading volume and company financial statements.

## Model
The model consists of two main components: a CNN network and an LSTM network. The CNN network is used to extract features from the historical stock market data, while the LSTM network is used to make predictions about future stock prices.

## Results
The model's performance will be evaluated based on its accuracy in predicting future stock prices. The results of the model can be visualized by plotting the predicted stock prices against the actual stock prices.

## Conclusion
This stock market prediction model can be used as a tool for investment decision-making. However, it is important to note that stock market prediction is a highly complex task and this model should not be relied upon as a sole source of information. It is always advisable to consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
